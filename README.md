# Orbitales

Orbitales is an art software to explore the orbital universe and make some prints and gifs

## Installation

Download this repository and open "orbitales.html"

## How to use

* I - To explore the orbital universe you can play with the parameters on the top of the page. The fun part is to combine them to make unexplored orbitals. You can play with the colors and the C A O S mode. 
* II - There are nine orbit modes you can choose them on the bottom and they change the course of the meteors, try exploring them :).
* III - The "Random" button creates a random orbit. The "Clear" button activates the clear mode which reset the orbit every time some thing is changed. The print button download a print of the orbital!

* On the bottom left corner you can see two buttons. The first one opens the download settings. On this tab you can set the number of frames, resolution and the file name to make a gif. The resolution of the gif is the same to the print image. The other button opens the Settings, where you can set the resolution of the canvas and also copy and paste the orbital code. The orbital code is the coolest feature -> if you want to save an orbital that you created you can click on "copy" button and then paste it on a notepad and save it. When you want to see it again you can copy the code and paste it on the indicated place :)
